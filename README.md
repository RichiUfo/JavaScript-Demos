JavaScript Demos
====================

These are just some small demos using Javascript libraries and technology.

Notes
- The Google Maps and Bootstrap examples are self containe. By this I mean the css and javascript are called from CDN.
- The require JS library has some elements relative to the folder, as well as CDN use.

For more information check out [my blog postings](http://jenntesolin.com/blog/category/javascript/).

Feel free to request new examples or code improvements via the issues functionality in GitHub.
